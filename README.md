# Feel The Beat (DragonHack 2018)

Android app we created on hackaton [DragonHack](https://dragonhack.si/). The app gets the bpm(beats per minute) of every song on your android device from an API and then detects your running/walking tempo and plays a song with the same tempo for you.

We won the best UX challenge with this app.
